Here are calculations we use to make the camera zoom 'into' mouse position

Known:
MouseToScreenPos1() = MouseToScreenPos2() = MouseToScreenPos()
Camera.aspect
zoom2

worldMousePos1 = worldMousePos2
CameraPositionΔ = Camera.position2 - Camera.position1

Unknown:
CameraPositionΔ = ?

Reasoning:
worldMousePos = ScreenToWorldPos(MouseToScreenPos()) =
Camera.position + ScreenWorldSize * MouseToScreenPos() =
Camera.position + Camera.orthographicSize * new Vector2(Camera.aspect, 1) * MouseToScreenPos()

worldMousePos1 = worldMousePos2
Camera.position1 + ScreenWorldSize1 * MouseToScreenPos() = Camera.position2 + ScreenWorldSize2 * MouseToScreenPos()
ScreenWorldSize1 * MouseToScreenPos() - ScreenWorldSize2 * MouseToScreenPos() = Camera.position2 - Camera.position1
MouseToScreenPos() * (ScreenWorldSize1 - ScreenWorldSize2) = CameraPositionΔ
CameraPositionΔ = MouseToScreenPos() * (ScreenWorldSize1 - ScreenWorldSize2)

ScreenWorldSize = Camera.orthographicSize * new Vector2(Camera.aspect, 1)

CameraPositionΔ = MouseToScreenPos() * (Camera.orthographicSize1 * new Vector2(Camera.aspect, 1) - Camera.orthographicSize2 * new Vector2(Camera.aspect, 1))
CameraPositionΔ = MouseToScreenPos() * new Vector2(Camera.aspect, 1)
  * (Camera.orthographicSize1 - Camera.orthographicSize2)
