TODO (the real one):
Stuff in other TODOS
Create Board material at runtime (elsewise it causes the enabled shader keywords to be saved between the sessions, which is bad)
UI
fps counter

TODO for video: 
Documentation
Make the actual video about it
Clean up the Excel sheet
Get rid of Odin and make custom editors
make a benchmark vs old simulation

TODO sometime maybe:
make the grid zoom calculation work in 3d (maybe, if yes use the code by bgolus)
anti-aliasing in the drawing shader code
