TODO (the real one):
UI
fps counter

TODO for video: 
Documentation
Make the actual video about it
Clean up the Excel sheet
Get rid of Odin and make custom editors
make a benchmark vs old simulation
allow to swap the old and new simulation compute shader

TODO sometime maybe:
make the grid zoom calculation work in 3d (maybe, if yes use the code by bgolus)
anti-aliasing in the drawing shader code
make a heatmap shader
async data redback to CPU
use hex literals in shaders and excel sheets for readability
kernel for editing multiple (at least 8x8) cells (basically SetPixel but with [numthreads(8, 8, 1)])
	+ use it when needed for better performance
add customizable colors to heatmap shader
	+ ability to round the current heatmap color to highest/lowest color (maybe for things like OTCA metapixel)
